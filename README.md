# fun_swap
FunSwap is a token swap program built on the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework. This program allows two parties to swap tokens with a deadline and grace period for approval. The program ensures atomic swaps, allowing both parties to exchange tokens safely within a specified timeframe.

This project was developred for the same private client I made (https://github.com/btorressz/FunSwap) for.
